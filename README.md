Data Sort Coding Challenge
The sort.pl script is a response ot the coding challenge of asking the end user to to read in a CSV file, then sort the data by selected columns and output the result in YAML format.
This particular script requires the following Perl modules from CPAN:
* DBD
* DBI::CSV
Use cpan -i Bundle::\<module-name\> to install required modules.  Ensure make, automake, and gcc are also installed on your system.
